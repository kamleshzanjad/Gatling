help_label = Enter label that will show up as the Field Name in the Details tab.  This is searchable in that tab by any key word, but should also be as short as possible for simplicity.
help_description = Enter larger description to support Label name if unclear.  No limit to describing functionality.
help_unit = Provides user a format description of the input in the Details tab.  Ex:  For a % input, enter \'%\' here.  Without entering this, a user will simply see a blank field in the Details tab with no clarity on what format to input.  The % sign alerts a user to enter \'8.0\' for 8% rather than \'0.08'\.
help_field_type = Choose what type of field this should be.\'Multi-Select\' allows a user to choose multiple options from a pick list. \'Select\' provides a drop down for choosing one option only.  \'Text\' is a basic field that allows input of anything. \'Numeric\' prevents users from entering anything that is not a number. \'Date\' will provide a calendar for users to choose. \'Yes/No\' display input values in text and it sends value as \'1/0\' to FMS respectively.
help_help_text = Any text entered here will show up in the \'?\' box next to this assumption in the Details tab to provide guidance to users on how to utilize this field.
help_minval = Users cannot input numeric values lower than provided min value.
help_maxval = Users cannot input numeric values higher than provided max value.
help_defaultval= When creating a new project, this field will be pre-populated with the value entered here.  The only exception is an Organization Default that would override this value when a project is solicited to another entity.
help_selectoptions =If Field Type is \'Multi-Select\' or \'Select\', enter the choices for selection here.  Fields should be separated by a comma.  Be careful to include spacing that coincides with the underlying excel model; ex:  If a selection in excel has options for \'Yes\' and \'No\', then these should be entered into the pick list as \'Yes,No\' with no spacing (a space after the comma would effectively be \'No\' which does not match the excel field and will be an error).
help_notes = Include any further helpful notes here to clarify how to utilize this assumption.
help_refname = This is the Reference Name of this field in Excel and the larger database structure. If an Input or Output in the underlying Excel model does not have a Reference Name, it will not be connected to Mercatus or display anywhere.  The Reference Name must match exactly between Excel and this entry.
help_mappedrefname = This is the Mapped Reference Name. See reference name help for more details. 
help_globalfield = Check this box if this field is \'Global\'
help_outputfield = Check this box if this field is an \'Output\', meaning the value of this field is derived using the Inputs and calculations of the underlying Excel model.  If checked and a user pushes \'Calculate\', this field will return a value from the excel model rather than send a value to the excel model.  Ex:  For \'NPV\', check this box to ensure the value is returned as a result of the calculations of the model.
help_ignoreupdate = When checked, respective assumption gets ignored when its value is returned from model calculation.
help_isrequried = If checked, this field will have a red \'REQ\' listed next to it in the Details tab.  A user cannot push \'Calculate\' without this field being complete and will receive an alert that directs the user toward a specific input that is missing.
help_portfolioconsolidation =Determines how this assumption will be consolidated within a portfolio if the project is selected for inclusion.  A user can select as many projects as desired for a portfolio, and when this occurs each assumption will be consolidated.  Ex:  If 5 projects are selected, the project costs could be consolidated using \'Weighted average (cost * capacity) Sum of all values\' while the Off-taker Name could be consolidated using \'first input having max count'\, as these are different field types and need separate consolidation outputs.
help_portfolioconsolidation_refname =Determines how this assumption will be consolidated within a portfolio if the project is selected for inclusion.  A user can select as many projects as desired for a portfolio, and when this occurs each assumption will be consolidated.  Ex:  If 5 projects are selected, the project costs could be consolidated using \'Weighted average (cost * capacity) Sum of all values\' while the Off-taker Name could be consolidated using \'first input having max count'\, as these are different field types and need separate consolidation outputs.
help_viewableby =Who can view this assumption?  Pyramids from top down, meaning if \'Developer\' is chosen, the Developer and any other Org Type can see this assumption; however if \'Financier\' is chosen, then Developer and External Org Types can not see this assumption. \'Developer\' refers to the orginating entity, or the entity that solicited this project, while \'Financier\' refers to the entity that received the solicited project and is reviewing it.
help_editableby = Who can edit this assumption?  Pyramids from top down, meaning if \'Developer\' is chosen, the Developer and any other Org Type can edit this assumption; however if \'Financier\' is chosen, then Developer and External Org Types can not edit this assumption.  \'Developer\' refers to the orginating entity, or the entity that solicited this project, while \'Financier\' refers to the entity that received the solicited project and is reviewing it.
help_assumptionlevel=When marked \'PROJECT\' then assumption input left blank when New Project created, when \'GLOBAL\' then assumption input uses Mercatus Default when New Project created, unless Client Default available, when \'CLIENT\' then assumption input uses Client Default when New Project created (this trumps Mercatus Defaults). For custom organizations this is always marked as \'PROJECT\'
help_readonly =When checked, respective assumption becomes uneditable on details screen. 
help_configonly =When checked, respective assumption becomes available for reporting in Deal Room.
help_usedbyanalytics = Indicates assumption is used by Analytics, if selected, management of assumption by users will be restricted. 
help_fmsimapct = If checked, this field will have a ___ icon listed next to it in the Details tab, indicating to a user that this field has an impact on the underlying financial model.  Helpful to track specifically which fields effect calculations and which fields are more pipeline related.
help_metric = Shows the width of this assumption column when used for reporting in the Deal Room.  Ex:  for assumptions with longer entries or text entries, may want to utilize larger number here to ensure the width for reporting is formatted sufficiently.
help_fieldformat = How the assumption is viewed when scanning the Details tab.  Ex:  \'#.##\' could be used for a user to view only \'1.05\' as a numeric field, for example.  The actual value here could be \'$1.046732199\', but it is rounded based on formatting listed in \'Field Precision\' below.
help_fieldprecision =How many digits are available for entry.  Ex:  \'14\' suggests a user can enter up to 14 digits for a numeric value or decimal placing; however the user will only view the assumption with the format listed in \'Field Format\' above.  See example there for more context.															
help_header =Enter \'Header\' text which will show up for this assumption when including it as a column for reporting in the Deal Room.  Used for abbreviating long assumptions from the Details tab to ensure simple formatting in Deal Room.  Ex:  \'Off-take Rate post TOD Adjustments\' in Details tab could simply be \'Offtake Rt ($ / kWh)\' for simplicity; user gets full context through Details tab.
help_displayunit=Provides user a format description of the input in the Deal room column.  Ex:  For a % input, enter \'%\' here.  Without entering this, a user will simply see a blank field in the Details tab with no clarity on what format to input.  The % sign alerts a user to enter \'8.0\' for 8% rather than \'0.08\'.
help_category=This field displays all the available categories, to move assumption to another category user can use this drop down.
help_linkedassumption=Field shows assumption which next to selected assumption as an option for child assumption, when user select any assumption here then that assumption is displayed as child assumption on Details screen. This field will be disabled for invalid cases.
help_commonlyused = When checked, respective assumption will be available in list of Commonly used assumptions for reporting on Deal Room.
